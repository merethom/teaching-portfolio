I come from a matrilineal tradition of artists and makers. As a young child, I had the privilege of watching my mother complete an education in textile art. She learned through making, and inadvertently taught me to do the same. Empathy is what connects me to the world around me and an intuitive understanding of others has always been my strongest skill; my empathic understanding is core to my identity. I came to design as a career choice because it allows me to blend my thirst for knowledge, making and problem solving while allowing my empathy to be my my strongest asset. It is these same things that fuel my passion and skill for design education. 

As an instructor in the Bachelor of Interaction Design program, I have the privilege of teaching design studio courses. These are dynamic, living studios, and my philosophy relates to this sort of teaching and learning environment. Passion for the subject alone does not make a great educator.  As with my design practice, I approach my classroom with an empathic mindset. The below are the manifestations of the empathic approach I take when teaching. My teaching and learning philosophy is derived from my own teaching experience and is then informed by the work of design and pedagogy scholars R. Buchanan, N. Cross, and M. Davis.

##### Design and my role as a design educator

I believe design (the activity) is an innately human activity; it involves manifesting that-which-is-desired in the here and now. It differs, from design (the discipline), which is assumed as a livelihood by many, myself included, where one undertakes design (the activity) professionally. It is my belief that the difference between the two lies in intentional experience with situated, reflective practice. I define interaction design as the design of the interactions between people and products, objects, things, and spaces.  At present in the IXD program this centres around primarily technology-related interactions. 

As an interaction design instructor, I teach a guided reflective practice of skills and methodologies that allow students to engage with interaction design as a profession. I classify methodologies as the overarching processes, frameworks, and strategies undertaken to solve what R. Buchanan calls 'wicked problems', whereas skills are the means by which designers articulate and prototype those solutions. Where methodologies will be used time and time again throughout the course of a designer's career, the specific skills and tools employed by designer will be forever changing and evolving. 

In my teaching, I have noticed that students, especially when starting out, tend see skills as the core component of interaction design. Thus, my role as an instructor becomes two-fold. I must assist them in discovering the importance of methodology as a core component of their design practice, while also fostering their ability to identify relevant new skills and then learn them. This ties in to my own belief about the benefits of learning through making; I aim to foster in curiosity in students because I have experienced the ability of that sort of learning to transcend a fear of failure. 

Ultimately, I believe my role as a design instructor is to guide reflective practice while developing students' fearless curiosity.

##### The mindset of inability

I do not believe students land in my classroom with a tabula rasa; they each bring with them their own unique understanding of the world and their place in it. I agree with J. Mighton that our students are receive much of their primary and secondary educated under the lens of the so-called Myth of Ability. As we delve into materials, most frequently coding or research, students often come to  me with the echoes of teachers and guardians past telling them "just not good at at this". 

I do not agree with that sentiment for a second. I believe that given the appropriate lessons and time, anyone can learn pretty much anything. I believe those students they are "just not good at it, yet". The truism would ring "you can do anything if you put your mind to it" but as an instructor, my job is to facilitate which strategy may help students grasp subject matter. This looks different for every student. Some students learn at lightening speed—it is my job to coach those students to even further places so they do not get board. Other students may require repetition—either in the way a concept is explained, or multiple opportunities to test a new skill before they feel confident with it. Others may just require time to process what they have learned before it makes sense. Ultimately, I believe there is no one-size-fits-all approach for learning a new skill, so I stock my teaching arsenal with multiple ways of teaching and explaining a concept.

##### Feedback in the studio

There is a long-standing tradition of design education being taught through an apprenticeship model, and the studio project is a signature pedagogy of design. Students are lead through projects that allow them to develop skills and methodologies they will use in their future design practice. I believe this model of instructor-guided reflective practice is very beneficial for students as it gives them an opportunity to turn a theoretical understanding into meaningful practice. I believe my role as an instructor is to guide this process in level-apprproate manner that allows each student to develop. I have found M. Davis's three pedagogical styles of design classrooms useful in articulating my approach to feedback in the classroom.

Davis outlines three primary pedagogical styles found in design classrooms: art direction approach, Socratic method, and coaching pedagogy. Each has its place in my classroom, and I rely on my empathic understanding of students to determine which approach will be most beneficial in a moment. I will often undertake a *coaching pedagogy* when working with students. Rather than art directing them with a specific cue, I suggest action-oriented strategies which can be accomplished in a reasonable time frame that will allow the student to draw meaningful conclusions on their own. I find the *Socratic method* of leading students with probing questions works well for more advanced students, or students further along in their design project. I find *art direction approach* is best left to the end of a project to help students, especially in group projects, tie their work together. When used at the beginning of a project, art direction perpetuates a master/apprentice power dynamic of which I am not partial. Although it may produce work that looks good, it does not provide the same opportunity for student growth and understanding; students may be pleased with their result but wholly unsure of why the piece is successful. My role as in instructor is not to solve all a student's problems for them, but to assist them along their own project journey, and I employ all three of these strategies in individual, group or class settings as course needs may dictate.

In my classroom I strive to create a space where students can succeed, but also fail fast, safely, and gracefully as sometimes they learn more from failure than from success. A huge portion of teaching design is observation. There is a tendency for students to stay within their comfort zone. Working in a comfortable creative space is good for building up a designer's confidence, but beyond that confidence,  will cause a practice to stagnate. It is my job as an instructor to observe when a student would grow more from the challenge of moving outside their comfort zone. That said, I wholly reject the pedagogy of intimidation often framed as a right of passage by the design industry. I have endured my share of vicious studio critiques, and found they tend toward more of an assault on personal character than feedback that has helped me grow. Desk critiques can be a stressful time for many new designers, and if this stress causes a student to become defensive or shut down, the opportunity for learning has disappeared. As M. Davis discusses, new designers are especially prone to this as they have not "learned to separate discussions of their work from their perceptions of self-worth"[90]. This does not mean I believe in tiptoeing around hard conversations, rather I've found there is a more empathic way for me to deliver difficult feedback that is constructive rather than destructive.

##### My take on classroom dynamics

Every classroom is unique. Even if I've taught a course multiple times before, the makeup of the students, time of day, classroom space, day of the week and even the ambient lighting change they dynamic of the classroom. I believe it is my role to assess this dynamic with empathy and adjust my method of delivery accordingly. In my experience, there are two categories these classroom dynamics fall under.



###### Intersectional Identities

In the Bachelor of Interaction design, my classrooms are diverse places that reflect the multicultural makeup of Canada. This affords our students the opportunity to encounter a vast array of lived experiences from their peers, however, it also presents some challenges. Both Academia and Design are traditionally white, heteropatriarchal spaces which can create barriers for students whose identities who fall outside those intersections. I never want a student to feel that their identity precludes them from being a part of the design community, so I strive to use inclusive language, diverse examples, call out bias (implicit and explicit) as it arises, and apologize when I make a mistake. I ask my students to do the same. As someone in a position of authority I believe is my duty to not only do no harm, but also to help students develop a critical lens for viewing their world. Neither teaching nor design are free of bias, meaning my identity as a straight-passing queer, CIS, white woman unavoidably influence my perspectives and interactions with students. However, I believe being outspoken about my intersectional feminist beliefs in my classroom can help make the space more welcoming to anyone who inhabits it.



###### Time and place

The timing and physical space in which a class is delivered affect my teaching strategies significantly. The past semester I taught two sections of the same course back-to-back in two different rooms. One was an afternoon course (3-6pm), and one an evening course(6-9pm) and it took different strategies to maintain the same level of engagement in each section. In the first week, I noted the afternoon course decreased in attentiveness over the span of the class, while the evening course increased in attentiveness as the class progressed. To address this, I modified the order of delivery for the same materials, tweaked some  activities to hit the more salient notes for each class. In particular, the evening class had difficulty focusing at the beginning of class, so to combat this Iadded a few minutes of small chat prior to the start of class to help the afternoon students land in the room, present and ready to learn.  I also had students wheel their chairs to the front of the room, and modified the lecture deliver to be more conversational. The result was a substantially more engaged and participatory classroom who engaged with the subject matter.
